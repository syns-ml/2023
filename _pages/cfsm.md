title: Call for Scientific Models

The workshop features two external contributions tracks: 
1. [Paper submission](/2023/cfp/) 
2. [Scientific model submission](/2023/csfm/)

The call for scientific models is an original component of this workshop that we consider key to fostering interactions between machine learning researchers and domain scientists. It will be open to any scientific computational model respecting quality standards such as: code publicity, recognised scientific quality, documentation, etc. All contributions shall clearly discuss the modelling assumptions and their limitations. Accepted submissions will be made publicly available on the workshop web page and will be presented at the poster session.

Criteria for a successful scientific model submission include: 
- Potential impact
- Documentation
- Scientific validity
- Accessibility

#### Awards & contributed talks
Awards shall be attributed to the four most oustanding contributions selected from the call for papers and the call for models with the financial supports of the workshop sponsors. Authors of the recognised contributions will have the opportunity to present their work as 15 minutes-long contributed talks.

#### Posters
Accepted scientific models shall preferably be presented as posters during the workshop. However, in order to facilitate viewing presentations in different time zones, the authors of each accepted scientific model will get the opportunity to submit a 10 minute video that summarizes their work. Authors of submitted papers will be able to indicate their preference for an in-person presentation or a virtual presentation. Instructions to upload videos will follow.

## Authors instructions

#### Double submission policy

All accepted works will be made available on the workshop website. This does not constitute an archival publication or formal proceedings; authors retain full copyright of their work and are free to publish their extended work in another journal or conference. We allow submission of works that overlap with papers that are under review or have been recently published in a conference or a journal, including physical science journals. However, we do not accept cross-submissions of the same content to multiple workshops at ICML 2023. 

#### Format
- Submissions should be anonymized short papers (extended abstracts) up to 4 pages in PDF format, typeset using the [paper template](/2023/assets/synsml2023_template.zip) of the workshop (adapted from the ICML template).
- The authors are required to include a short statement (approximately one paragraph) about the potential broader impact of their work, including any ethical aspects and future societal consequences, which may be positive or negative. The broader impact statement should come after the main paper content. The impact statement and references do not count towards the page limit.
- The ICML style template includes a paper checklist intended to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research ([see associated guidelines](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperGuidelines)). We advice authors to follow those best practices when possible.
- Appendices are *highly discouraged*, and reviewers will not be required to read beyond the first 4 pages and the impact statement.
- Workshop organizers retain the right to reject submissions for editorial reasons: for example, any paper surpassing the page limitation or not including the broader impact statement will be desk-rejected.
- Submissions will be kept confidential until they are accepted and until authors confirm that they can be included in the workshop. If a submission is not accepted, or withdrawn for any reason, it will be kept confidential and not made public.

#### Submission platform
Submissions should be uploaded in pdf format on [openreview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2023/Workshop/SynS_and_ML).

## Reviewers instructions
Submissions that follow the submission instructions correctly (i.e., are not rejected due to editorial reasons, such as exceeding the page limit, missing the impact statement, etc,) are sent for peer-review. Below are some of the key points about this process that are shared with the reviewers and authors alike. Authors are expected to consider these in preparation of their submissions and when deciding to apply for the reviewer role.

- Papers are 4 pages long. Appendices are accepted but highly discouraged; the reviewers will not be required to read the appendices.
- There will be multiple reviewers for each paper.
- Reviewers will be able to state their confidence in their review.
- We will provide an easy-to-follow template for reviews so that both the pros and the cons of the submission can be highlighted.
- Reviewers are expected to have an up-to-date openreview profil as the paper matching will rely on the openreview matching algorithm. 
- Potential conflicts of interest based on institution and author collaboration are addressed through the openreview review system.
- Criteria for a successful paper submission include: novelty, correctness, relevance to the field, at the intersection of ML and sciences, and showing promise for future impact. Negative or null results that add value and insight are welcome.
- Criteria for a successful scientific model submission include: novelty, correctness, relevance to the field, at the intersection of ML and sciences, and showing promise for future impact. Negative or null results that add value and insight are welcome.
- There will be no rebuttal period. Minor flaws will not be the sole reason to reject a paper. Incomplete works at an advanced progress stage are welcome.
