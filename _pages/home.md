## Introduction

The Synergy of Scientific and Machine Learning Modeling Workshop ("SynS & ML") is an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the challenges of combining scientific and machine-learning models.
The goal of the workshop is to gather together machine learning researchers eager to include scientific models into their pipelines, domain experts working on augmenting their scientific models with machine learning, and researchers looking for opportunities to incorporate ML in widely-used scientific models.
