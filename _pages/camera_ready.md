## Paper Submission Track

- Submissions should be short papers (extended abstracts) up to **5 pages** (4 pages in initial submission + additional 1 page for accepted papers) in PDF format, typeset using the **[LaTeX template](/2023/assets/synsml2023_template.zip)** of the workshop (adapted from the ICML template).
- Accepted papers should display the authors' name and affiliation. Please use `\usepackage[accepted]{synsml2023}` command in the LaTeX template.
- The authors are **required to include a short statement (approximately one paragraph) about the potential broader impact of their work**, including interdisplicanry nature of the work, any ethical aspects, or future societal consequences, which may be positive or negative. The broader impact statement should come after the main paper content. The impact statement and references do not count towards the page limit.
- The ICML style template includes a paper checklist intended to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research ([see associated guidelines](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperGuidelines)). We advise authors to follow those best practices when possible.
- Appendices are *highly discouraged*.

## Scientific Model Submission Track

- The authors of accepted scientific models can modify the submission directly on the Google Form. Please refer to the email that you received in the initial submission to find a link for the modification. If the link does not work, please contact the organizers at [synsandml@gmail.com](mailto:synsandml@gmail.com).
