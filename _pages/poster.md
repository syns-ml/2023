Authors of both tracks can display a poster per submission in either of the two poster sessions of the workshop (we will announce the session assignment soon).

Some instructions:

- Posters should be no larger than 61cm x 91cm (24" x 36") in portrait. **A1 portrait** paper would be the most adequate.
- Posters should be printed on lightweight paper.
- Please tape your poster directly to the wall using **only** the tape we provide.

If something is unclear, please don't hesitate to contact the organizers at [synsandml@gmail.com](mailto:synsandml@gmail.com) :)
